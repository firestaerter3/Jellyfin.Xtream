The `ParseName` function now correctly strips these tags from series and movie titles.\n\n### Supported tag formats\n- `[TAG]` - Square brackets\n- `|TAG|` - ASCII pipe\n- `\u2503TAG\u2503` - Box drawing heavy vertical (U+2503)\n- `\u2502TAG\u2502` - Box drawing light vertical (U+2502)\n- `\uff5cTAG\uff5c` - Fullwidth vertical line (U+FF5C)\n- Spaces inside pipes: `| TAG |`, `\u2503 TAG \u2503`\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/rolandb5/Jellyfin.Xtream/compare/v0.9.1.3...v0.9.1.4",
