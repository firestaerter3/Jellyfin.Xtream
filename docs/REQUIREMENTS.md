# Requirements

This document defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Jellyfin Xtream Library plugin.

## Problem Statement

Jellyfin's channel-based plugins (like the standard Xtream plugin) present IPTV content as "Channels" which have limited client support. Specifically:
- Swiftfin (iOS client) has broken channel support
- Channel items don't integrate with Jellyfin's metadata providers
- No support for collections, playlists, or watch history
- Limited UI compared to native library items

## Solution

Create STRM files that point to Xtream streaming URLs, allowing content to appear in native Jellyfin Movie/TV Show libraries with full metadata and client support.

## STRM File Specification

### Format
Single-line text file containing the streaming URL.

### Movie URL Pattern
```
{BaseUrl}/movie/{Username}/{Password}/{StreamId}.{Extension}
```

### Episode URL Pattern
```
{BaseUrl}/series/{Username}/{Password}/{EpisodeId}.{Extension}
```

### Example
```
http://provider.example.com:8000/movie/user123/pass456/12345.mp4
```

---

## File Naming Conventions

### Movies
```
{SanitizedName} ({Year})/{SanitizedName} ({Year}).strm
```
Example: `The Matrix (1999)/The Matrix (1999).strm`

### Movie Quality Variants
```
{SanitizedName} ({Year})/{SanitizedName} ({Year}) - {VersionLabel}.strm
```
Example: `The Matrix (1999)/The Matrix (1999) - HEVC.strm`

Multiple variants coexist in the same folder. Jellyfin detects them and shows a version picker. See [MOVIE_VERSIONS.md](MOVIE_VERSIONS.md) for full details.

### Episodes
```
{SanitizedName} ({Year})/Season {N}/{Show} - S{NN}E{NN} - {Title}.strm
```
Example: `Breaking Bad (2008)/Season 1/Breaking Bad - S01E01 - Pilot.strm`

### Episode Without Title
```
{Show} - S{NN}E{NN}.strm
```
Example: `Show Name - S02E10.strm`

### Generic Title Handling
Titles like "Episode 5" are stripped as they add no value.
